WARNING EXTREMELY BASIC TODO APP

The purpose for making this app was to illustrate how to use the following

1. Typescript with a web project.
2. Setting up a project using parcel
3. Dom manipulation and string interpolation with javascript/typescript
4. And finally using the handy dandy bubbling concept of EventHandlers :)


### Getting started
Pull this project and run `npm install`. After everything is installed run `npm run dev`. This should start the parcel server on port 1234.

head to http://localhost:1234 to see the app.
